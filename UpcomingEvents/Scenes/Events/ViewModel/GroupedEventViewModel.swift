        // let arr = [1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12]

        // 1 against 2     2 against 4    4 against 5    5 against 9    9 against 10   10 against 11   11 against 12

        // O(n * log n). This because of the running time consist of N loops that are logarithmic thus the algorithm is a combination of linear and logarithmic. Even though we are sorting first, this will still be O(n * log n)
